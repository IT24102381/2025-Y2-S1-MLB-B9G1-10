# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview 

This project focuses on preprocessing the Telco Customer Churn Dataset to prepare it for machine learning modeling.
The objective is to clean, transform, and enhance the dataset using different preprocessing techniques such as missing value handling, encoding, scaling, outlier removal, feature engineering, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction.
Each preprocessing technique was handled by one group member, and the results were integrated into a single pipeline.
